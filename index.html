<h3>The Story</h3>
<p id="bolt">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="Neighbour"> <i> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” </i> </q> The farmer said, “<em>maybe</em>.” <q class="farmer"> <i> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, </i> </q> “<em>maybe</em>.” </p>
<br>
<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="Neighbour"> <i>“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,” </i> </q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"> <i> “<em>maybe</em>.” </i> </q>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="Neighbour"> <i> “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “<em>maybe</em>.” </i> </q></p>
<br>
<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>  — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span>  fortune.</p>

    <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> , but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</i></blockquote>
